    "A difficult problem where traditional neural networks fall down is called object recognition. It is where a model is able to identify the objects in images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CIFAR-10 Problem Description\n",
    "The problem of automatically identifying objects in photographs is difficult because of the near infinite number of permutations of objects, positions, lighting and so on. It’s a really hard problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a well-studied problem in computer vision and more recently an important demonstration of the capability of deep learning. A standard computer vision and deep learning dataset for this problem was developed by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR).\n",
    "\n",
    "The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 photos divided into 10 classes (hence the name CIFAR-10). Classes include common objects such as airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats and so on. The dataset is split in a standard way, where 50,000 images are used for training a model and the remaining 10,000 for evaluating its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The photos are in color with red, green and blue components, but are small measuring 32 by 32 pixel squares.\n"
